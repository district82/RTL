<p>This project is a merger from the 'Thyme' and 'QBit and GParticulates' repositories. It combines the backpropogation reinforcement learning algorithms in i9.c and the probability calculations which make use of decision tables and the Markov Decision Process witht he theorem of time.<br><br>The purpose is to try to get an accurate probability over time by calculations and learning constantly from the partial derivatiove VEL which is a Matrix of time T and differential V.<br><br>It is still a work in progress since it is theorem. More work to be done later.<br><br></p>
